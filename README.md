# Restaurant-Management-System
This project is a restaurant ordering and billing system for a fictional restaurant named 'PAN ASIA.'It begins by displaying a welcome message and then prompts the customer to enter their name, phone number, address, and the date. The program presents a menu divided into different categories: Indian Accent, Thai Choice, Korea Court, Japan Jewels, China Station, and Gulp It Down Asia, each containing various dishes with their respective prices. The customer selects items from these categories by entering the dish number and quantity. The selected items are added to an order list, and the customer can choose to continue ordering or finalize their order. Once the order is complete, the program generates a detailed bill, displaying the customer's information, ordered items with their quantities and prices, the gross amount, applicable taxes (SGST and CGST), total GST, and the net amount to be paid. The bill concludes with a thank-you message, encouraging the customer to return.
